<p>Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a developer living in Salisbury, UK. I'm the creator of <a
        href="https://frozenplain.com">FrozenPlain</a>.</p>
<p>My interests include software development, music, philosophy and rock climbing. This website is just a place to
    share some of my interests and ideas with others.</p>

<h3>FrozenPlain</h3>
<p><a href="https://frozenplain.com">FrozenPlain</a> is my main work. It's a company that makes <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample-based_synthesis">sample-based
        software synthesisers</a> and audio plugins: tools for composers and producers to make music.</p>

<h3>Signet</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/samwindell/signet">Signet</a> is a free open-source command-line tool for bulk-editing
    audio files. It's very useful for sample-library developers who often work with 100s of audio files that
    need to processed in a similar fashion so they can be effectively used in a sampler.</p>
