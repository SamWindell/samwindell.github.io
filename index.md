Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a developer living in Salisbury, UK. I'm the creator of [FrozenPlain](https://frozenplain.com).

My interests include software development, music, philosophy and rock climbing. This website is just a place to share some of my interests and ideas with others.

## Projects

### FrozenPlain
[FrozenPlain](https://frozenplain.com) is my main work. I make [sample-based software synthesisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample-based_synthesis) and audio plugins: tools for composers and producers to make music.

### Signet
[Signet](https://github.com/samwindell/signet) is a free open-source command-line tool for bulk-editing audio files. It's very useful for sample-library developers who often work with hundreds of audio files that need to processed in a similar fashion so they can be effectively used in a sampler.
