Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a software developer from the UK. My main project and work is [FrozenPlain](https://frozenplain.com).

I use this place to share things that I think interesting. It's also a collection of my evolving ideas: my blog posts here aren't necessarily immutable, final publications - they can change.

My interests include low-level software development, music, sound-design, ancient philosophy and self-improvement. I care about the quality of my work and want to make things that are truly useful - beyond just the surface level.

## Projects

### FrozenPlain
[FrozenPlain](https://frozenplain.com) is my main work. I make [sample-based software synthesisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample-based_synthesis) and audio plugins: tools for composers and producers to make music.

### Floe
[Floe](https://github.com/Floe-Synth/Floe) is a free, GPL licenced, sampler plugin that I'm developing. It powers FrozenPlain's sample libraries.

### Signet
[Signet](https://github.com/samwindell/signet) is a free open-source command-line tool for bulk-editing audio files. It's very useful for sample-library developers who often work with hundreds of audio files that need to processed in a similar fashion so they can be effectively used in a sampler.
