<p><a href="https://frozenplain.com">FrozenPlain</a> started back in 2013 when I was fresh out of college. I was
    fascinated by the idea of sampling real-world sounds - often unusual sounds - and turning them into 'virtual
    instruments'. I already had an interest in composing electronic and film-score type music, but the idea of
    making my own instruments - and potentially being paid to do it - was very drawing.</p>

<p>My first main project was <a href="https://frozenplain.com/product/terracotta">Terracotta</a>. I took a whole
    array of terracotta flowerpots from my parent's garden-shed and sampled them being hit with a rubber mallet. I
    then took the recordings and put them inside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontakt_(software)">Kontakt</a>;
    tuning them, and creating an interface to control their character using Kontakt-Script.</p>

<p>After many years working with Kontakt I realised how much I enjoyed the programming aspect of the work. I also
    started wanting to make things that weren't possible in Kontakt. And so I transitioned into developing audio
    software using C++. Fast-forward many more years and now my focus is <a
        href="https://frozenplain.com/mirage">Mirage</a>; a sampler-engine of my own. I want to keep growing Mirage
    into an incredible tool - designed to genuinely provide value to people wanting to make music.</p>
